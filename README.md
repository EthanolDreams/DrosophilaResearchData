# Colby Drosophila Studies Research Database

This is the storage and processing center for all the colby
drosophila studies research studies. Here the video files 
and the their resulting data files are housed, along with 
perhaps a few other data processing models.

Currently, it is assumed that we will be using the 
FOSS software, Blender (blender.org), to be able to process
our video files, however, if a more suitable solution arises
or is developed, then we shall use that one instead.

It is recommended that if you are not adept with using 
git, that installing git management software is preferred.

There are several on the market, all for free,
you can use GitKraken, which is very popular, 
I would recommend github desktop, above that though, and 
I think that most could get by with using Visual Studio Code.

For the git uninitiated, 
`git` and `github` are linked, 
but inherently different pieces of software. Git manages, through very fancy math and theory, the differences between files and determines how they vary from each other in content, while github stores the information of git + the project, so that we can all share and have a nice safe backup. :)


It's been extremely challenging to find a robust tracker
which is fast and *correct*.

This XKCD sums it up nicely.
